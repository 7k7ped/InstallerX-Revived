## Introduction

> A modern and functional Android app installer. (You know some birds are not meant to be caged, their feathers are just too bright.)

Looking for a better app installer? Try **InstallerX**!

Many customized Chinese ROMs come with subpar default installers. You can replace them with **InstallerX**.

Compared to stock systems, **InstallerX** offers more installation options:
- Dialog-based installation
- Notification-based installation
- Automatic installation
- Installer declaration
- Option to install for all users
- Allow test packages
- Allow downgrade installation
- Auto-delete APK after installation

## Supported Versions

- SDK 34+ (full support)
- SDK 30-33 (limited support, please report issues)

## Changelog

- Simplified UI
- Fixed APK deletion issues from original repository
- Text adjustments, added Traditional Chinese support. PRs for more languages welcome!
- Improved version number display for apps to be installed
- Added targetSDK and minSDK display during installation

## FAQ

- **HyperOS shows error** `System app installation requires valid installer declaration` **what to do?**
  - System security restriction. You need to declare a system app as installer in settings (recommended: `com.android.fileexplorer` or `com.android.vending`)
  - Planning to add: "Auto-detect HyperOS and add installer to default config"

- **Not working on Oppo/Vivo/Lenovo devices?**
  - We don't have these devices for testing. Please discuss in [Discussions](https://github.com/wxxsfxyzm/InstallerX-Revived/discussions)
